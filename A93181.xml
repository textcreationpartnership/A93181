            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN conſideration that variety is moſt taking, eſpecially of
ſuch things as are highly neceſſary; I have thought it convenient, not
only for Delight, but for the <hi>Accompliſhment</hi> of the <hi>Female
Sex,</hi> to ſet forth what muſt undoubtedly turn to their advantage, and
conſequently more than a <hi>Preface</hi> can expreſs, or a <hi>ſudden
conception</hi> bring forth, if ſeriouſly and deliberately conſidered, to
a degree of Practice; for indeed without induſtry, <pb facs="tcp:154073:5"/> the
ſmalleſt matter cannot be brought to perfection. Things Natural and
Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial owe their Original to Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; the firſt to the
viſible and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Workings of Nature; the ſecond to that of the
Creature: nor without theſe could the World ſubſiſt. But to come nearer
the ſubject-matter.</p>
            <p>In the following Treatiſe you will find not only Approved Rules,
Inſtructions and Directions for particular perſons, whoſe ability and
leaſure may contribute in an extraordinary manner to the higheſt
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement, but ſuch as are ſutable to all degrees and capacities; ſuch
as muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Advancement of each Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Female, to a
Station that may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her acceptable in the eyes of great ones, or at
leaſt create her a good repute, and pronounce her happy, though moving in a
lower ſphere. All that we can term <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd</hi> in Female
Conduct, is briefly to be found in the following Pages; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into ſo
eaſie and plain a method, that it will, no doubt, inſenſibly attract 
<pb facs="tcp:154073:5"/> the deſire of the Reader to make an Eſſay; and that
Eſſay being found both profitable and delightfull, will carry her further
in the progreſs of Pleaſure and Advantage, till ſhe confeſſes the
Time and Coſt was well beſtowed, and becomes an Admoniſher of others to
make the like improvement; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature being more exact in
directing the <hi>Female Sex</hi> in what is ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profitable from
Infancy to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Age, and is a fit Companion upon all commendable
occaſions, in whatſoever ſtate or condition, even from the <hi>Lady,</hi>
to the inferiour <hi>Servant-Maid;</hi> being a <hi>Directory,</hi> in which
nothing neceſſary for the Accompliſhment and Qualification of the Sex is
omitted, in relation to Education, Breeding, good Manners, courtly Deportment,
prudent Conduct, and Management of Affairs, being the very Quinteſſence of
whatever has been practiſed or publiſhed, and more perhaps than can
probably be expected in ſo ſmall a Book. But thinking no labour too much to
advantage the fair Sex, I have travelled through the <hi>World of
Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:154073:6"/> to furniſh out this <hi>Cabinet of
Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi> in hopes it will find a kind accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and turn to the
advantage of thoſe who rightly conſider it. In expectation of which, I

them over, for brevities ſake, I come to the ſecond thing to be
conſidered, which is the manner of cutting up.</p>
               <p>If you take it upon you to Carve a Swan, called in the proper
term Lifting, ſlit him down-right in the middle of the breaſt, and through
the back, from the neck to the rump, laying the ſlit ſides downward in the
diſh, without tearing the fleſh, and ſerve the ſawce up in Sawcers.</p>
               <p>The term of Carving a Gooſe is to rear or break her in this
manner. Take off the legs very fair, then cut of the belly-piece round, cloſe
to the lower end of the breaſt, and with your knife, lace her down on each
ſide a thumbs breadth from the breaſt-bone, taking off the wings with the
fleſh you firſt laced, raiſing it cleaver from the bone, then cut up the
merry-thought, and another piece of fleſh which you formerly laced; turn the
carkaſs, and divide it at the back-bone above the loin; then lay the rump end
of the back-bone at the fore-end of the merry-thought with the fleſhy ſide
upward, and the wings on each ſide contrary, that ſo the boney end of the
legs may ſtand up in the middle of the diſh, and the wings on their
out-ſide, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="47" facs="tcp:154073:29"/> under the wing Pinions, the two long
pieces of fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let the ends meet under the
leg-bones.</p>
               <p>In carving or diſmembring a Hern. Lace her down the breaſt,
and take off both the legs; then raiſing up the fleſh, take it clean off
with the Pinions; then ſticking the head in the breaſt, ſet the Pinion on
the contrary ſide of the carkaſs, and the legs on the other ſide, ſo
that the ends of the bones may meet croſs over it.</p>
               <p>In cutting up a Buſtard or Turkey. The leg being raiſed up
very fair, open the joynt with the ſharp point of your knife, and lace down
the breaſt on both ſides, without taking off the leg or the pinion; then
raiſe up the merry-thought, and between the top of the breaſt-bone and the
merry-thought, lace down the fleſh on both ſides, and raiſe up the
fleſh called the Brawn; turn it outward on both ſides, but neither cut it
off nor break <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it may find the better acceptance: As,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you have a friend at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you would oblige
more than another, &amp; if Chickens boil'd be the firſt diſh, the breaſt
is to be preferred, and next the leg; for in all boiled fowl, the leg is
accounted better than the wing; though in roaſted ones, if they be wild-fowl,
the wing is chief: and the reaſon that is given is, becauſe it is exceeding
ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by means of its continual motion; and add, as a curioſity on the
other hand, that the legs of tame fowl not uſing the wing, but too often
ſcratching, are to be preferred as the beſt nouriſhment; though it is
generally held in wild and tame fowl, as Pullets, Turkies, Capons, Geeſe,
Duck, Mallard, Pheaſant, Dotril, and the like, that the merry-thought and the
wing is beſt, however they are moſt acceptable, and the next part, that
which is laced on the breaſt-bone.</p>
               <p>As for Butchers meat. In roaſt Beef, that which is within

               <p>In a Loin of Veal the Nut-piece or Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-piece is the beſt
to be preſented.</p>

in-ſide, above the handle, that is fit with the meat upon it to be
preſented, and is in great eſteem among the curious: As it appeared by a
Gentleman, who after long Courſing, being extream hungry, and finding that
bone untouched in a cut Leg of Mutton, refuſed to eat by reaſon he fancied
Booriſh people had had the firſt handling of it, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe their
diſcretion would have direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to have taken that piece.</p>
               <p>A Shoulder of Mutton being cut between the handle and the flap,
the fat Nut there found is the choiceſt piece, and worthieſt to be
preſented. And in a roaſted Pig the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eſpecially prefer the under
Jaw and the Ear, though on the other hand the Neck and middle-piece is
preferrable.</p>
               <p>In a Hare, Coney or Leverit, the back-piece, juſt in the
middle, is held of great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, though ſome nicely covet the piece by the
ſide of the tail, commonly called the Huntsman's piece.</p>
               <p>In all Fiſh without ſhells, the Jole, or that part next to
the head, is to be eſteemed; and in a Lobſter or Crab, the claw.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:154073:31"/>If Fiſh or ſliced Fleſh be in Paſte,
'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to touch it with your Knife, Fork or Spoon; and raiſing it
conveniently, lay it upon a Trencher or Plate in the beſt order, not by any
means, delivering it to the hand of the party with your Knife, Fork or Spoon,
but on a Plate.</p>
               <p>All ſorts of Tarts, Cuſtards, wet Sweet-meats and Cakes,
being cut in the diſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were ſerved up, muſt be layed
like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the point of a Knife, handſomely on a Plate and
preſented.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed you how to behave your ſelf, and, in
ſome part to manage good cheer; it will be highly neceſſary to
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a young Gentlewomans Beauty is an Ornament next to that of

Tuterage, as in ſuch caſes is uſual, behave your ſelf kindly towards

your Mouth at once, nor eat too greedily: Let not your Mouth or Fingers be
greaſy no more than needs muſt; and when you are ſatisfied, take your
Plate or Trencher with you, or give it to thoſe that wait, and retire, but
not out of the Room till Grace is ſaid, and the Cloth taken away; at what

be innocent and moderate, never ſtaying late abroad; and, above all, be wary
in the choice of your Companions; and as you grow up, ſhun the Converſation

Lightneſs and Wantonneſs is adminiſtred; nor lend your Ear to
diſcourſe tending to Lewdneſs; and, for the generality, rather chuſe to
be ſeen than heard.</p>
               <p>For your Carriage, in the general, let it be a Medium, not
expreſſing too much reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs, which, by ſome, is interpreted
Pride; nor too much freedom or familiarity, which, on the other hand, will be
looked upon for Fondneſs. Be no Makebate between your Parents and their
Servants; nor at any time tell a Lye to excuſe a fault, or keep you from the
hand of correction. Go to bed in <pb n="193" facs="tcp:154073:102"/> due ſeaſon, without
any noiſe, and never be ſeen in unſeemly Laughter; nor in pointing with
your Finger, or nodding with your Head, eſpecially in company, or in places
of Divine Worſhip: Honour Age, and pity thoſe that are diſtreſſed by
Poverty, or any other Affliction; Speak not at any time ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or in a

repute, and forward your ſelf in thoſe things that will render you

requiſite to be known that I have not yet mention'd; an account of which, as
they offer, I ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in their proper places: And, in the firſt

Parents to inſtruct a Young Gentlewoman; as alſo of the Maid-Servant that
is to attend her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for your Governeſs, if diſcreetly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, ſhe muſt
be a Woman of gravity and <pb facs="tcp:154073:103"/> diſcretion, one that is
learned in curious Arts, ſuch as you are deſirous to improve; and although
her Age render her reſerved, yet muſt you not cenſure her as ridged, but
comply with her lawfull Commands; and by your mildneſs and induſtry move
her to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, refraining by all means to make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, eſpecially
unjuſt ones; for in diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of her, whom your Parents has thought fit
to ſet over you, you tax them with Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility in chuſing, and by that
Complaint will either incur their diſpleaſure, or, by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your
Governeſs, perhaps procure a worſe: which cauſing, undoubtedly, a
ſecond Complaint, will poſſeſs your Parents with a jealouſie of your
untractableneſs and ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>Some there are that covet to be under a young Governeſs, with
whom they may have the more familiar converſation, though to their ſmall
advantage; for it is ſomewhat improbable that a Perſon, who cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Govern her own youthfull frailties, ſhould diſcharge ſo great a Truſt
as ſhe ought; Nor is it Morally poſſible for any Perſon to be a good
Governeſs, unleſs ſhe has her ſelf been the Mother of Children, and had
the bringing them up; for then, and but till then, can ſhe be fully
ſenſible of Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full frailties, and know what tenderneſs, and what
Correction ought to be uſed: <pb n="195" facs="tcp:154073:103"/> However, conſider with
your ſelf, that in being comfortable to her, you obey your Parents, who
thought fit to commit you to her charge; and that if you do otherwiſe, you
diſobey God, in abuſing or ſlighting their care and indulgence, who
ſtudy your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: Therefore let not the Servants, nor any other, create
a miſunderſtanding between you and her, but in Prudence and Charity forget
or forgive what ever you conceive to be an injury, as wiſely conſidering
you are no competent Judge in your own caſe.</p>
               <p>To the Servants you muſt be courteous and affable, but not
over-familiar, leſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get contempt. Tell no Tales of them to your
Parents, but rather ſtrive to hide their failings, unleſs they be ſuch as
are prejudicial or unſeemly; and do them what good you can. If at any time
you find occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, let your Reproofs be rather
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhments than Reproaches: Be not pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh nor froward in your
Dreſſing, or in any other office done you by the Maid, that more
immediately attends you, but by gentle words let her know her Error, that ſhe
may amend it: which method will oblige and command a conſtant diligence,
which otherwiſe would be but Eye-ſervice; and if your Parents be angry with
their Servants, or any of them, do you become their Mediator: And turn not, by
any means, your Face from the Poor; <pb n="196" facs="tcp:154073:104"/> but if it be in your
power, without offending your Parents, relieve them; or, as you ſee
occaſion, petition on their behalf: by which demeanour you will command Love
and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and gain the Character of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit: In which you may

ſuch a place a Young Gentlewoman by her folly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedneſs expoſe
her ſelf to Laughter or Contempt, obſerve, that if you underſtand the
Rules of Dancing; yet be not too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to engage your ſelf therein, leſt
you intangle your ſelf ſo far, that you are puzled, and at a loſs,
perhaps for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Rules and Formalities practiſed in
that place. And as you ought not to be too forward, ſo be not too hard to be
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, <pb n="210" facs="tcp:154073:111"/> or abruptly, in a huffing humour, force
your hand from any that offers to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate you, but rather run the hazard
of an error or miſtake in your performance, than let the leaſt pride or
rudeneſs appear; or give thoſe that are preſent, occaſion to think you
are ſubject to either.</p>
               <p>In this caſe be not, by any means, affected; nor when you
undertake to Dance, be not tedious, but perform what you undertake with
Modeſty and Moderation, that by a quick diſpatch you may give way to
others.</p>
               <p>As Dancing is an External Accompliſhment, ſo Vocal Muſick
is an Internal one, yet they may indifferently ſerve for either, though the
laſt is preferred; therefore if you are expert in your Notes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and can Sing well, when you are in company, upon the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Friend, who knows you ſo qualified, be not obſtinate in complying; yet
be brief, and let your Song be ſuch as may give no offence: and when you have
done, look not as if you expected Applauſe, but keeping your Station with a
compoſed Countenance, give way to another to ſecond you, if any preſent
is deſirous, or can be prevailed with to do it; obſerving never to cough
nor ſtrain when you enterprize it, nor to ſtop in the middle to crave
Attention: And the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in your playing on Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
not in that Point being tedious in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing <pb n="211" facs="tcp:154073:111"/> your
Harmony, when others do the like: give attention, not interrupting them with
diſcourſe. And in this caſe let both your Songs and Tunes be modeſt,
ingenious and pleaſant, avoiding, by any means, what may tend to the
corruption of good Manners: And as Dancing is the beſt and readieſt way to
put the Body, upon all occaſions, in a gracefull poſture; ſo Muſick is
that which tempers the Soul with mildneſs, and diſpoſes it to
ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>In Limning, or Drawing to the Life, many Young Gentlewomen, as
well of former as latter times, have exerciſed their Parts, and in that
Curioſity found much Recreation; it being, in my Opinion, an Art ſutable to
the accute Wit of the <hi>Female Sex:</hi> Nor is Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to be rejected, for
by that is the Mind enlivened, as it were, and tuned to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Numbers
of the Muſes, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with lofty Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>Next to theſe, Engraving may take place, a thing practiſed
by many Virtuous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women: but amongſt ſolitary Recreations, if they
may be ſo termed, Reading of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, or ſuch Romances wherein Virtue
and Gallantry are lively Portrayed; or ſuch as contain Stories of chaſt and
virtuous Love, are to be preferred.</p>
               <p>Theſe being allowed, I think it not amiſs to adviſe Young
Gentlewomen, at leaſure hours, <pb n="212" facs="tcp:154073:112"/> to recreate
themſelves in ſeeing Stage-plays, wherein many things are repreſented,
that by due conſtruction, may redound to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in
underſtanding; though ſome are ſo Stoically ſevere, to condemn this
kind of Recreation, as altogether tending to the corruption of good Manners;
yet they can give little reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuck-like Recreations being to be preferred, there
is ſomething more to be conſidered; which is the fit Time or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principal thing to be conſidered in this caſe is, how
you ought to keep within compaſs, and not run into exceſs, or any ways give
offence, damage, prejudice or ſcandal to any; or by immoderate purſuing it,
impair your Health or Reputation, which too often falls out; beſotting a
cheerfull Complection, and over-whelming, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the principal Virtue.
And if you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider this, and conſequently recreate your ſelf
with Moderation, at ſeaſonable hours, and in proper ſeaſons, it will
not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quicken your Apprehenſion, but contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much to your bodily
Health; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any-ways offenſive to the Almighty, who debars us from
nothing innocent and harmleſs that is for our advantage. So that from hence I
may draw a concluſion, That Men and Women may enjoy thoſe Pleaſures 
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:154073:112"/> to which they, with Modeſty and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, incline;
with a proviſo, they launch not out ſo far as to abuſe them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Inſtructions for the Guidance of a Young Gentlewomans
fancy, in relation to Love; and how ſhe ought to behave her ſelf towards
thoſe that ſeek to gain her in Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving laid down many things highly neceſſary, and mainly
conducing to the Accompliſhment of a Young Gentlewoman; I ſhall now proceed
to a more difficult and weighty matter than what has hitherto been mentioned;
and that is, to direct her how to guide her Fancy in the Mighty buſineſs of
Love; A thing, you'll ſay, ſomewhat ſtrange to propoſe: But what cannot
the Merits of a virtuous Woman create in the Mind of her Admirer. This indeed,
if it proved happy and ſucceſsfull, will undoubted make her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in her
former care and diligence, and render her an entire felicity on Earth; for Love
is the Concord and Harmony of the Univerſe, nothing ſubſiſting in its
proper or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der without it; nor can there be any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs 
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154073:113"/> when it is wanting; yet there is, as in this caſe, as
in many others, degrees, or rather counterfeits; for Love it ſelf, in its
purity, admits of no Adulteration or mixture, but is eſſential and
unlimited: but many there are that would appear to wear the badge of this
ſacred Virtue, who only make it an Umbrage to obtain their unlawfull
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and advantage: And though they may indeed, for a time, expreſs an
extraordinary Paſſion, and, not to ſpeak the worſt of 'em, entertain a
feavouriſh deſire; which is to be known by their earneſtly gazing upon
the Object they at that time perhaps admire; yet it being only a Paſſion,
and not founded upon Virtue, it is not properly Love, nor can it render the
expected felicity; but bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing a while in the enjoyment it ſought, ſpends
it ſelf; and being ſpent, like a falſe Star or Comet, expires: or, on the
other hand, not obtaining its ends, changes into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard or mortal hatred;
and of ſuch a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whether at the time it is propoſed, real or
feigned, you muſt beware.</p>
               <p>That Young Gentlewomen, arriving at maturity, are prone to Love
and Liking; it would be inſignificant for one to relate, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo
well known. The Eye and the Ear being ſeldom wanting to convey to the Soul
what is deſirable; the one charming it with beautifull ſights, and the
other with <pb n="215" facs="tcp:154073:113"/> rhetorical and melodious ſounds; yet give
not theſe official members too much ſcope on this occaſion, leſt they
inſenſibly ruin you, by betraying your Affections to what is ſordid or
inconſiderable; but keep, as it were, a guard upon your Heart, to prevent the
entrance either of a lawleſs or diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Paſſion. Conſider
well before you give way, even to imagination in that kind; weigh deliberately
each particular, and be ſeriouſly intent on what is to come, as well as
what is preſent, not ſuffering your ſelf, for the preſent ſatisfying
your Appetite, to be carried away with the Torrent of a Paſſion, that will
unavoidably carry you into the Gulf of Miſery. Man indeed is a noble
Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and for his ſake Woman was made, and therefore ought to be
complacient; but being left at liberty to chuſe where ſhe thinks fit for
her advantage, it is more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence to make ſuch a choice to her
humour. The former of which may, but the latter cannot be quickly diſcovered:
But, above all, let not a Young Gentlewoman for Intereſt, or by
over-perſwaſion, give her ſelf to one ſhe cannot affect, leſt ſhe
dearly repent at leaſure what is paſt redreſſing, there being nothing
more grievous than a loathed bed, for that, moſt commonly, cancels all other
Earthly felicities; nay, many times ſhakes the very foundation of Modeſty,
and <pb n="216" facs="tcp:154073:114"/> ſtruggles with Virtue, till it enters at one door,
and drives it out at the other. And this is too often the Parents cruelty to
their Daughters, who being paſt the youthfull pleaſure of a Reciprocal
Love, aim rather at their Greatneſs than their Happineſs; though contrary
to the opinion of Wiſe <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> who, on the like occaſion,
preferred an honeſt Poor Man, before a Rich vitious Man; in theſe words,
<hi>viz. That he had rather Marry his Daughter to a Man without Money, than to
Money without a Man.</hi> And much to the ſame purpoſe was the Anſwer of
the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous <hi>Portia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Cato,</hi> upon her being
demanded when ſhe would Marry; ſaid ſhe, <hi>When I find one that ſeeks
my Love more than my Riches;</hi> that is, one that ſhe could meet with an
equal Paſſion.</p>
               <p>As for your Behaviour in this caſe, it muſt be grave and
modeſt, though not ſowre or too much reſerved, leſt it be interpreted
for Pride, or want of diſcretion. Bluſhes, upon ſundry occaſions, are
very ſeemly; which, like moving Oratory, let your Lover know the little
Flames of Love are playing about your Heart, and ſilently betray your
Paſſion.</p>
               <p>A kind of pleaſing Love there is, which, though it have taken
poſſeſſion of the Heart, is either through modeſty, or fear of
failing if it were propoſed, deſirous to be concealed; not but that if
theſe Obſtacles were removed, <pb n="217" facs="tcp:154073:114"/> they would freely
diſcover it. And this, Gentlewomen, is on your part, who love thoſe that
are ignorant of your Paſſion; yet did they know it, would be more
tranſported than your ſelves. And this you ſtrive to expreſs by the
ſilent Language of the Eyes, for Lovers Eyes will talk; nor is it always in
their power to keep them from wandring. But in this, as in all the myſtery of
Love, move with deliberation, and let Caution be the ſcale of your Affection.
Conſider your happineſs, or its contrary depends upon the caſt; and that
there are many conſequent matters or circumſtances that a diſcreet Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will not only diſcourſe, but diſcuſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe enter upon that
Honourable, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, ſtate of Matrimony: And theſe chiefly are to be
taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in Deſcent: Fortunes and Friends
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beget diſtraction in the mind: Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable years create
diſlike; and loathing obſcurity of Deſcent, begets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and
unequality of Fortune, diſcontent. Theſe are the hazards to which
unconſidering Lovers expoſe themſelves; theſe the Rocks on which they
ſhipwrack their Peace: And yet herein you ought to be contented, if once it
is paſt redreſs.</p>
               <p>As you ought to be ſlow in entertaining Lovers, ſo be
conſtant in retaining one that is worthy, that you may thereby gain a 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154073:115"/> greater eſteem. Boaſt not of the multitude of your
Suitors; nor be proud that you are admired above others of your rank and
qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Give not thoſe you cannot fancy ground to believe you do or will
love them; neither by rudeneſs, unſeemly words or carriage, any affront,
but decline, as much as with modeſty and civility you may, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
giving them as little opportunity as may be to find you alone; nor receive any
thing from them by way of Preſentation, leſt, when they find they are
rejected, they exclaim againſt you as mercenary, or one that gives way to
Courtſhip for your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Be not covetous of Strangers acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on
this occaſion; nor rely too much upon a Female-confident, leſt the one
prove troubleſome, and the other pick-locks your Breaſt of thoſe Secrets
you are not deſirous to publiſh. Whining and ſneaking Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are
likewiſe to be avoided; as alſo ſuch as ſtrive with Tears and
Imprecations to poſſeſs you with an opinion of their good meaning: But
where Manly Beauty, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Spirit, Moderation in Speech, and a greater
readineſs in performance, than in promiſing, are centered in one Perſon;
who tempers his Actions with diſcretion, humility and ſobriety, you ought
to be complacient; and if ſuch a one fall to your ſhare, imagine your Lot
is caſt in a fair Land; and till <pb n="219" facs="tcp:154073:115"/> you find ſuch an

Diſcretion ought to tend; though ſome, more forward than wiſe, think, if

beyond all peradventure; who, in his Eternal Wiſdom, thinking it not fit for

to be the ſweet Co-partner of his pleaſure, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in the eaſie

               </argument>
               <p>AS Marriage is an Honourable Eſtate, ſo are there many
weighty things to be obſerved by thoſe that enter upon it; though Love is
the ſupreme matter, yet it ought to be attended with Prudence, Care, and
Diligence, or elſe it will waſte it ſelf, and totter in its Sphere; and,
above all things, repine not at your lot when it is fallen to your ſhare, but
weigh your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſcale of Content and Diſcretion, and it will
be the better ſupported.</p>
               <p>If your Husband be very young, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Excurſions
incident to youthfull frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let your riper experience bring him to a better
underſtanding, and your uſage more eaſie, than to attempt by extremities
to wean him from what he affects; but rather let your good Example, modeſt
Reprovements, and the courſe of Time work upon his head-ſtrong Nature; and
either through ſhame, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <pb n="224" facs="tcp:154073:118"/> of Judgment, he
will be brought to be himſelf; for doubtleſs Conjugal duty, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with
ſoftneſs and affability, is of force to conquer the Moroſeſt
temper.</p>
               <p>If your Husband be much ſuperiour to you in Years, ſo that
he is not as comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able able as Youth, yet let his Years beget in you a
greater Reverence and Reſpect; and let his ſage Inſtructions be your
Rule, and the ſquare of your Actions; keeping in all things his Counſel,
and not ſuffer ſo much as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt Thought to defile his Bed; Locking
up his Counſels in your Breaſt as a ſacred Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of Truſt, and bear
with his infirmities, being in his Age a Staff to ſupport him, and a Hand of
help upon all lawfull occaſions.</p>
               <p>If your Husband is Exalted in the World by Riches or Honour, let
not your Mind be puffed up, nor Pride come near your Heart, but be affable,
humble, courteous and charitable, which will gain you a Name not to be
purchaſed with Treaſure; and wink not at your Husband's over-laviſh
profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor at his over-penurious or covetous inclination, but mildly
admoniſh him of the ill conveniency and danger of either, that ſo he may be
perſwaded to reſerve a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Care for his own, and avoid Exceſs;
and, on the other hand, enjoy what is fitting, and ſhun baſeneſs.</p>
               <p>Though after Marriage you find your ſelf <pb n="225" facs="tcp:154073:118"/>

the things of this World, as Riches and Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you
expected; but that, on the contrary, you are griped with the pinching hand of
Poverty, let the poor condition of your Husband add to your Virtue, in
furniſhing you with Patience and Meekneſs; for there is not that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
want, ſome imagine, where there wants no content: and in this, by any means,
croſs the unadviſed Proverb, of <hi>Loves going out at
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ne Door, when Poverty
comes in at the other:</hi> And ſo conſequently falling into a cold and
Aguiſh diſtemper, dies unlamented. And let your Affection contemporize in
all Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor be ſhaken with the Winds of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, ſeeing no
improſperous Affair ought to divide you from him to whom you have vowed your
Faith, and unto whom you have individually tied your ſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe things reſolved, and well expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, your
Chriſtian conſtancy will make you fortunate in ſpite of oppoſition; nor
will the bitter encounter of unſeaſonable or undue Repentance ſtruggle
with your Mind, or ever prevail againſt your Reaſon. In this caſe the
Example of ſome Women have been famous.</p>

               <p>The more particular Duties of a Wife, or rather Obligations of
